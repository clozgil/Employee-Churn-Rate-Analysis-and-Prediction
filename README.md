# Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing human resource data on employees and building a model that can predict which employees are more likely to quit. Hiring and retaining workers can be a costly task for any business. By focusing on an accurate model that can predict an employee's retention, we could reduce an organization's employee churn rate and potentially save the organization time and capital. 

For this project, we will briefly manipulate data using pandas, perform exploratory data analysis using matplolib and seaborn, and build a few classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, and one deep learning model, Artificial Neural Networks, using tensorflow.


## Data Source

We will be using IBM's HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performanced dataset for this project. It can be obtained from Kaggle in the link below. <br>

This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. I hesitate to use data from Kaggle since it's often very clean and ready. We miss the opportunity to gather data and practice data manipulations. Still, for the purpose of this project, good insights can be drawn from this data set. I do have an entire project on data collection and manipulation below. <br>

## Observations

As the notebook progresses, there are sections were I note an observation. Those will be shown as
